# Welcome

##### This is a chat app made with socket.io

---

Follow the steps below to run this code on your machine:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/siddhantk232/u-chat.git
    cd u-chat
    npm install
    node ./app.js
    and open index.html in the client folder
```

#### I will also make a chat app with better UI in future :-)
